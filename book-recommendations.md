For a statistics textbook that is deep but not dry in style, these 3 stand out:

* **Stats: Data and Models** by _Richard De Veaux_, _Paul Velleman_, and _David Bock_
  takes a conversational tone that emphasizes intuition over computation.
  The book uses practical examples and engaging visuals, breaking down complex concepts
  with clear, student-friendly explanations to avoid dryness while still being deep.[1]

* **Statistical Rethinking** by _Richard McElreath_ (2018) is praised for fostering intuition through
  simulations, coding, and practical examples rather than heavy theoretical derivations.
  It balances rigor with an enjoyable learning experience and includes a focus on modeling and
  Bayesian techniques, making it less dry and more engaging for serious learners.[2]

* **Naked Statistics** by _Charles Wheelan_ (2013) offers a fun, clear, and anecdote-rich introduction
  to statistics that makes challenging concepts approachable and interesting without overwhelming
  the reader with dense math. It is excellent for readers looking for depth
  conveyed in an accessible style.[3][1]

These books are known for their engaging writing styles combined with solid statistical substance,
suitable for learners who want depth without the dryness typical of many traditional textbooks.

If you lean toward Bayesian approaches and computational examples,
**Statistical Rethinking** offers a modern, lively approach.

For broad foundational coverage with conversational clarity,
**Stats: Data and Models** is a top choice.

For a refreshingly clear introduction with practical relevance and a light tone,
**Naked Statistics** works well.[1][2][3]

These selections provide a balance between rigorous content and readability,
addressing the request for deep yet not dry statistics textbooks.

## Personal note and older list (ca. 2005) by Zed Shaw
Zed Shaw's essay "Programmers Need To Learn Statistics Or I Will Kill Them All"

[as of 2014-03-31](https://web.archive.org/web/20140314001238/http://zedshaw.com/essays/programmer_stats.html)
caught my attention in 2009 but lack of time prevented further study.

2. Introductory Statistics with R; Dalgaard. ISBN 0387954759
